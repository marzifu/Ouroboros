# RodXY
A CoreXY 3D Printer designed by Marzifu, with the main goal of achieving low cost and high performing printer.

### Preface

I am not a professional, just an avid 3d printer enthusiast. Last owned a Kingroon KP3S Pro V2 and it had tons of problems with the CANBus and the motherboard.

So I then swapped the mainboard to a SKR Mini E3 V3, but since my bed is warped and the whole thing is sitting in a corner because the hardware (broken pulley and a warped bed), here I am, designing my own CoreXY Printer.

## Main Goals
1. Create a working CoreXY Printer with decent printing speed (250mm/s?)
 > I don't know the exact spec I want, but being able to reach a 10.000mm/s and a250mm/s speed is a good benchmark for my initial design. Next step would be changing the motors and maybe the belts for bigger printing plaform.
2. Minimize the cost of manufacturing the printer
 > At the time I am using a 20XX VSlot extrusion and there's some machined part for the bed, I want to maybe change it to 30XX since here in Indonesia the price might be cheaper. Other than that I might want to redesign some of the structure to have more rigidity but less extrusion needed.
3. It's for everyone.
 > I want this build to be a blueprint that can be improved on by anyone, since after my experience designing the moving parts, it is kind of finicky. I hope we'll be able to build something for everyone with low budget in mind.

## Side Goals
1. Create a janky multi-color system for the RodXY
 > This has been a side goal, that I might try to achieve by having 3-5 extruders funneled into the main extruder carriage. I will be using the same mainboard its just that the mosfet on this board has been blown.
2. Sell it?
 > Since here in Indonesia there's really no 3d printer manufacturer, and the price of a lot of printer just doesn't make sense. I hope that by selling a kit or an complete assembly of a 3d printer would make the idea of "3D Printing is affordable" to be in people's mind (bit far fetched, but it's my honest hope regardless).


#To Do List
1. Re-Drawing the whole design as currently today, 12 August 2024, I have some more design considerations and ideas for the rig. Especially regarding the extruder and the main carriage design.
2. Creating an extruder design!
   > This thought comes because using BMG the nozzle is offset by a little bit and is not centered, which if I were to add a leveling sensor I would have to compromise on the placement and it would look janky-ish and I want to avoid    that. The main design inspiration is the ![Orbiter](https://www.orbiterprojects.com/orbiter-v2-0/) by Lorincz Robert and ![Sherpa Micro](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Micro-Extruder/tree/main) by Annex Engineering.
3. Save up for the main carriage prototype
4. Build the whole thing!
