# CubeXY
A CoreXY 3D Printer designed by Marzifu, with the main goal of achieving low cost and high performing printer.

### Preface
I like printing, but sometimes its fussy and my old printer needed a ton of work for it to be printing reliably and it can't print the higher temp materials like PETG and ABS with good results. 

So then I thought, what if I built a machinen that can do that with a budget as small as possible and make it so that everyone can build it themselves?

## Main Goals
1. Create a working CoreXY Printer with decent printing speed (250mm/s?)
 > I don't know the exact spec I want, but being able to reach a 10.000mm/s accel and 250mm/s speed is a good benchmark for my initial design. Next step would be changing the motors and maybe the belts for bigger printing plaform.
2. Minimize the cost of manufacturing the printer
 > This means I need to find the easiest and cheapest materials that everyone can get and still give the best possible effect with that materials. My goal is to push the cost as little as possible
3. It has to be enclosed
 > Having seen a lot of enclosed printer lately and thought that might be cool, the first idea is to use acrylic, and I'll go from there. Though I will be leaving the top side open, since I still haven't figured out the correct build to accommodate a fully enclosed one.
4. Fully automatic calibration
> This has been a point of thought too, since after some time adjusting Z offset and whatnot every other print is just not fun. So I want to make the calibrations of the printer can be done automatically, easily, and accurately. Less setting more printing I guess.
5. It has to be quiet
> After using a 5015 powered part cooling fan and switching the cooling to dual 4010s, it felt like a dream. I forgot my printer was inside the room and just felt "woah its printing" and thought that was a good idea, although I don't know if that's an actual good idea instead of using a possibly quiet 5015s

## Side Goals
1. Making it available
> What I mean  by this is possibly making a half assembled part for anyone that is interested or wants to get into 3D printing. I know it's kinda ambitious, but maybe it's doable somehow. Especially here in Indonesia I thought that if I can make it cheap and accessible 3D printing could be more mainstream.
2. Multi-color?
> I have an inkling of an idea to make a sort of extruder station that could store a couple of filaments and that would get pushed into a single extruder. Which would require 2 boards or a board with quite a lot of stepper drivers, this is a plan.
3. Upgrades!
> Hardware changes and software changes will always be posted here, But why is this one side goals? Because I mostly am slow at understanding what's needed for the next step be it in hardware or software, and there might be a lot of feedback and thus I will take more time.

# To Do List
1. Drawing the initial design
2. Listing the rough Bill of Materials
3. Building the v1
4. Testing and calibrating
5. Happy printing~ (I hope)

 
# Bill Of Materials
### Will be updated soon!
The parts will be separated into categories for an easier time to understand the needed materials.
