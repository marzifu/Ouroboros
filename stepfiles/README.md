# A Slight Warning
The designs I have are rough. I have no actual experience in any CAD designs.

I find some parts have a slightly cursed geometry or slices, and that is because that is the only idea I have to actually solve the problem at hand.
Please scrutinize my designs, and help me learn and improve in designing stuff.

Other than that please edit the files to your hearts content :)

# Overview
Attached is a (v1) overview

The picture and the 'version' tag will be continously updated with newer versions of the model.

The next goal is to have a rendered version to showcase here with different sections.
